  abstract = {The undergraduate data science curriculum at the University of California, Berkeley is anchored in five new courses that emphasize computational thinking, inferential thinking, and working on real-world problems. We believe that interleaving these elements within our core courses is essential to preparing students to engage in data-driven inquiry at the scale that contemporary scientific and industrial applications demand. This new curriculum is already reshaping the undergraduate experience at Berkeley, where these courses have become some of the most popular on campus and have led to a surging interest in a new undergraduate major and minor program in data science.},

Different kinds of tools and microworlds are needed. After discussing general requirements for such programs, a prototypical ideal software system will be presented in detail. It will be illustrated how such a system could be used to construct learning environments and to support elementary data analysis with exploratory working style.}

  abstract = {Computing makes up a large and growing component of data science and statistics courses. Many of those courses, especially when taught by faculty who are statisticians by training, teach R as the programming language. A number of instructors have opted to build much of their teaching around the use of the tidyverse. The tidyverse, in the words of its developers, "is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next" (Wickham et al. 2019). The shared principles have led to the widespread adoption of the tidyverse ecosystem. No small part of this usage is because the tidyverse tools have been intentionally designed to ease the learning process and cognitive load for users as they engage with each new piece of the larger ecosystem. Moreover, the functionality offered by the packages within the tidyverse spans the entire data science cycle, which includes data import, visualisation, wrangling, modeling, and communication. We believe the tidyverse provides an effective and efficient pathway to data science mastery for students at a variety of different levels of experience. In this paper, we introduce the tidyverse from an educator's perspective, touching on the what (a brief introduction to the tidyverse), the why (pedagogical benefits, opportunities, and challenges), the how (scoping and implementation options), and the where (details on courses, curricula, and student populations).},

  abstract = {Efforts to improve computer science education are underway, and teachers of computer science are challenged in introductory programming courses to help learners develop their understanding of programming and computer science. Identifying and addressing students' misconceptions is a key part of a computer science teacher's competence. However, relevant research on this topic is not as fully developed in the computer science education field as it is in mathematics and science education. In this article, we first review relevant literature on general definitions of misconceptions and studies about students' misconceptions and other difficulties in introductory programming. Next, we investigate the factors that contribute to the difficulties. Finally, strategies and tools to address difficulties including misconceptions are discussed.             Based on the review of literature, we found that students exhibit various misconceptions and other difficulties in syntactic knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and strategic knowledge. These difficulties experienced by students are related to many factors including unfamiliarity of syntax, natural language, math knowledge, inaccurate mental models, lack of strategies, programming environments, and teachers' knowledge and instruction. However, many sources of students' difficulties have connections with students' prior knowledge. To better understand and address students' misconceptions and other difficulties, various instructional approaches and tools have been developed. Nevertheless, the dissemination of these approaches and tools has been limited. Thus, first, we suggest enhancing the dissemination of existing tools and approaches and investigating their long-term effects. Second, we recommend that computing education research move beyond documenting misconceptions to address the development of students' (mis)conceptions by integrating conceptual change theories. Third, we believe that developing and enhancing instructors' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), including their knowledge of students' misconceptions and ability to apply effective instructional approaches and tools to address students' difficulties, is vital to the success of teaching introductory programming.},

Second, while Perl is well known, we call Randomo a Placebo-language, where some of the syntax was chosen with a random number generator and the ASCII table. We compared novices that were programming for the first time using each of these languages, testing how accurately they could write simple programs us- ing common program constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables, parameters). Results showed that while Quorum users were afforded significantly greater accuracy compared to those using Perl and Randomo, Perl users were unable to write programs more accurately than those using a language designed by chance.}

In recent years, as its adoption has increased worldwide in K-12 (largely in middle/high school) and at universities, it has expanded to be a powerful, commercial-grade, programming language that includes support for 3D gaming, music, and other fun and creative activities. While new features are designed for all, they maintain compatibility for people with disabilities, including a novel way for individuals who are blind to create 3D games. Finally, Quorum is the first language to use human-factors evidence from both field data and randomized controlled trials in its design. This approach provides the broader research community an organized way to influence the design of the language over time according to evidence based practices. We call this approach evidence-oriented programming. A laptop would help participants follow along with the session and handouts will be provided.

  abstract = {Recent studies in the literature have shown that syntax remains a significant barrier to novice computer science students in the field. While this syntax barrier is known to exist, whether and how it varies across programming languages has not been carefully investigated. For this article, we conducted four empirical studies on programming language syntax as part of a larger analysis into the, so called, programming language wars. We first present two surveys conducted with students on the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords, but that languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did. These results, including the specifics of syntax that are particularly problematic for novices, may help teachers of introductory programming courses in choosing appropriate first languages and in helping students to overcome the challenges they face with syntax.}

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore a set of literature in order to clarify the flipped classroom methods (FCM) theoretical frameworks and to determine if the evidence shows improvements in learning for students in comparison with traditional teaching methods. Design/methodology/approach The paper took a literature review approach and explored five articles selected with specific criteria of being published within 2013-2014 and that used comparisons with flipped and traditional classroom methods that employed analysis of student assessment outcomes. Findings The paper shows inconsistent theoretical frameworks and inconclusive evidence of an improvement in assessment outcomes for students. It finds the research undertaken in the literature is limited in scope and suggests further research into the FCM is required to determine consistent theoretical frameworks and methods. Research limitations/implications The findings of the paper may be limited by the selection of literature reviewed and generalisability therefore researchers are encouraged to explore further. Practical implications The paper holds potential implications to question the consistency, validity and benefits of the flipped classroom. Social implications Many anecdotal articles herald the flipped classroom as a method of improving learning outcomes for students, however, academic literature suggests the evidence is inconclusive and there are implications on using educational methods based on technology. Originality/value The paper identifies the need for further research into the flipped classroom and supports the advancement of educational methodology.},
